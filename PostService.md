# Post Service - Recommendations

## Overview

This document outlines the key components and best practices for building a scalable and production-ready **Post Service** that supports uploading images and videos, processing (resizing and transcoding), and storage. The service will use **Multer** for handling file uploads and will integrate with cloud storage (e.g., **Amazon S3**) and content delivery networks (CDNs) like **CloudFront** or **Akamai** for efficient content delivery.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language (Runtime):** JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js)
- **Framework:** Express.js or Nest.js
- **File Upload Handling:** Multer for handling multipart form data
- **Image Resizing:** Sharp or Jimp for resizing images
- **Video Transcoding:** FFmpeg for transcoding videos into multiple resolutions _**[Must have a separate service with message brokers]**_
- **Message Broker:** SQS or RabbitMq or Kafka
- **Storage:** Amazon S3 for storing uploaded media
- **CDN:** CloudFront, Akamai, or any other CDN for efficient content delivery
- **Database:** MongoDB or PostgreSQL for storing post metadata with **ORMs** and **Queries builder**

## Key Features and Recommendations

### 1. File Upload Handling with Multer

- **Multer** will handle file uploads (both images and videos) via multipart form data.
- Configure **file size limits** and filter to allow only image/video MIME types (e.g., `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `video/mp4`).
- Handle large file uploads efficiently by streaming files directly to storage (Amazon S3).

### 2. Image Upload and Processing

- **Image Resizing:** Once an image is uploaded, it will be resized to multiple resolutions (e.g., 1280x720, 640x360) using a library like **Sharp** or **Jimp**.
  - Example resolutions:
    - Thumbnail: 150x150
    - Small: 640x360
    - Medium: 1280x720
    - Large: 1920x1080
- **Format Conversion:** Optionally, convert images to web-friendly formats (e.g., **WebP**).
- **Storage:** After processing, the images will be stored in **Amazon S3**.
- **Caching via CDN:** Use a CDN (like **CloudFront** or **Akamai**) to cache the images and serve them efficiently to users.

### 3. Video Upload and Processing

- **Transcoding with FFmpeg:** Once a video is uploaded, it will be transcoded using **FFmpeg** to multiple resolutions (e.g., 480p, 720p, 1080p). This ensures compatibility with different devices and bandwidth conditions.

  - Example resolutions:
    - 360p: 640x360
    - 480p: 854x480
    - 720p: 1280x720
    - 1080p: 1920x1080

- **Adaptive HLS (Optional):**
  - If the uploaded video is longer than 5 minutes, it can be transcoded into **Adaptive HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)** format to provide streaming with adaptive bitrate based on network conditions.
  - For shorter videos (less than 5 minutes), they can be uploaded as regular **VOD (Video on Demand)** files.
- **Storage:** The transcoded videos will be stored in **Amazon S3** and organized into folders based on resolution and format (HLS or MP4).

### 4. Amazon S3 and CDN Integration

- **Amazon S3:** Store all processed images and videos in **Amazon S3** for scalable storage.
  - **Bucket Configuration:** Use appropriate S3 bucket policies to ensure the content is private by default and accessible through signed URLs or public CDN access.
- **CDN for Video Streaming:**
  - Use a **CDN** like **CloudFront** or **Akamai** to deliver content to users globally with low latency.
  - Integrate with the **HLS streaming** format for adaptive bitrate streaming, ensuring smooth video playback based on users' bandwidth.
  - For VOD, serve files (MP4 format) directly from the CDN.

### 5. Handling Large Files and Upload Optimization

- **Multipart Upload:** For large video files, use **S3â€™s multipart upload** to upload chunks of the video simultaneously, ensuring faster and more reliable uploads.
- **File Validation:** Validate uploaded files for acceptable size, format, and type before processing.

### 6. Fault Tolerance and Scalability

- **Asynchronous Processing:** Offload image resizing and video transcoding tasks to background workers (using a message queue like **RabbitMQ** or **Bull**) to ensure the upload process is non-blocking.
- **Auto-Scaling:** Use cloud-based infrastructure (AWS, GCP) to automatically scale services based on upload and processing load.

### 7. Security Best Practices

- **Authentication & Authorization:** Authenticate users via JWT (from the Auth Service) to ensure only authorized users can upload media.
- **File Access Control:**
  - Use signed URLs for accessing private content stored in S3.
  - Restrict direct access to S3 content via appropriate bucket policies.
- **HTTPS/TLS:** Ensure all uploads and downloads happen over secure HTTPS connections.

### 8. Logging and Monitoring

- **Logging:** Use libraries like **Winston** or **Morgan** for request logging and debugging.
- **Monitoring:** Integrate with monitoring tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to track processing times, storage usage, and CDN performance.
- **Error Tracking:** Use a service like **Sentry** or **Loggly** for tracking any errors during the upload and processing stages.

### 9. Containerization and Deployment

- **Docker:** Containerize the Post Service using **Docker** for ease of deployment and consistency across environments.
- **Orchestration:** Use **Kubernetes** or **Docker Swarm** to manage and scale the Post Service across multiple instances.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline using tools like **GitHub Actions**, **Jenkins**, or **CircleCI** to automate testing, build, and deployment.

### 10. Environment Variables

- Use **dotenv** or a similar package to manage environment variables, such as AWS credentials, S3 bucket names, CDN URLs, and JWT secrets.

## Additional Considerations

### 1. Video Preview and Thumbnails (Optional)

- Extract video thumbnails using **FFmpeg** for preview images during video uploads.
- Store and serve the thumbnails via S3 and the CDN for efficient delivery.

### 2. Quota and Limits (Optional)

- Implement user-level quotas for upload sizes and storage usage to prevent misuse of the system.
- Set maximum upload file size limits (e.g., 5GB) for videos and images.

### 3. Adaptive Bitrate Transcoding (Optional)

- Use **AWS MediaConvert** for large-scale video transcoding and adaptive bitrate streaming if the service requires complex video processing workflows.

### 4. Data Backup and Redundancy

- Ensure regular backups of uploaded content (especially videos) on S3 and the database to prevent data loss.
- Set up multi-region replication on S3 for disaster recovery and redundancy.

## Conclusion

By following these recommendations, the Post Service will be capable of handling large-scale image and video uploads, with optimized processing workflows for resizing and transcoding. Leveraging cloud storage and CDN services ensures that the media is stored securely and served efficiently, providing a robust and scalable solution for managing posts with multimedia content.
